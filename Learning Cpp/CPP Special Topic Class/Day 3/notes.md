# Friend Functions:

- The function is not in the scope of the class to which it has been declared as a friend.
- Friend functionality is not restricted to only one class
- Friend function can be declared in the private or public section of the class.
- it cannot be invoked using the object of the class. It can be invoked like a normal function without using the object of the class.

# Operator overloading:

- it is a compile time polymorphism
- redefining the meaning of operator doesnt change default behaviour
